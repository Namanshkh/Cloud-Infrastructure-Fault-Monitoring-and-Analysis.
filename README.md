# Cloud-Infrastructure-Fault-Monitoring-and-Analysis.

Analysis of the system logs provides us useful information for identifying system/application`s important knowledge that helps in better usage of system resources. Although, it is not simple task to just scan through every raw log message on a regular basis for large-scale systems. The two most difficult task in reading logs are firstly the volume of these unstructured log messages and secondly correlating the log messages to system events. These factors limit the large-scale system logs firstly for generation alerts or warnings on known system events, and also prevents diagnosis for identifying previously unknown system events that impacted the systems performance. In our project, we will be building a log monitoring UI framework that shows analysis of system events in real-time.
Our UI framework provides a organized view of log events real time The logs are analyzed and processed and is viewed on our UI interface.
